1.1 Identifying Operations in Snippets

Objects/Variables Created:
Six objects/variables are created: ix1, ix2, ix3, ix4, ss1, and ss2.


Types and Values:
ix1 is an int with a value of 20.
ix2 is an int with an unspecified value.
ix3 is a function taking no arguments and returning an int.
ix4 is an int with a value of 0.
ss1 is a string with a value of "****".
ss2 is a string with a value of "&&&".
ss3 is a string with a value of "htm".
ss4 is a string with a value of "x.htm".
ss5 is a string with an unspecified value.
ss6 is a string with a value of "x.png".


Operations:
ix1 is initialized with a value of 20.
ix2 is default initialized with an unspecified value.
ix3 is declared as a function taking no arguments and returning an int.
ix4 is value initialized with a value of 0.
ix2 is copy assigned the value of ix4.
ss1 is value initialized with a value of "****".
ss2 is list initialized with a value of "&&&".
ss3 is list initialized with a value of "htm".
ss4 is copy initialized as "x." concatenated with ss3.
ss5 is default initialized with an unspecified value.
ss6 is copy initialized as "x." concatenated with "png".
ss2 is copy assigned the value of ss4.
ss1 is copy assigned the value of ss2.


Errors:
ix3 is not initialized as a function. It should be declared without the parentheses: int ix3;.

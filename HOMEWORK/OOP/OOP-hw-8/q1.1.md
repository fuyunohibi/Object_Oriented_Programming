## 1.1 Identifying Operations in Snippets

### Objects/Variables Created:
- ix1: int, value of 20
- ix2: int, unspecified value
- ix3: function taking no arguments and returning an int
- ix4: int, value of 0
- ss1: string, value of "****"
- ss2: string, value of "&&&"
- ss3: string, value of "htm"
- ss4: string, value of "x.htm"
- ss5: string, unspecified value
- ss6: string, value of "x.png"

### Operations:
- ix1 is initialized with a value of 20.
- ix2 is default initialized with an unspecified value.
- ix3 is declared as a function taking no arguments and returning an int.
- ix4 is value initialized with a value of 0.
- ix2 is copy assigned the value of ix4.
- ss1 is value initialized with a value of "****".
- ss2 is list initialized with a value of "&&&".
- ss3 is list initialized with a value of "htm".
- ss4 is copy initialized as "x." concatenated with ss3.
- ss5 is default initialized with an unspecified value.
- ss6 is copy initialized as "x." concatenated with "png".
- ss2 is copy assigned the value of ss4.
- ss1 is copy assigned the value of ss2.

### Errors:
- ix3 is not initialized as a function. It should be declared without the parentheses: `int ix3;`.

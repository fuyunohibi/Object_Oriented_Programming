# 1.2 Identifying Operations in Snippets

### Objects/Variables Created:
- x: int, value of 42
- px: int pointer, value of the address of x
- rx: int reference, reference to x
- p2: int pointer, dynamically allocated memory with value 1024
- p3: int pointer, dynamically allocated array of size 4 with values {1, 2, 3, 4}
- p4: int pointer, value of p3
- p5: int pointer, dynamically allocated memory with value 0
- p6: int pointer, value of p5

### Types and Values:
- x: int, value of 42
- px: int pointer, value of the address of x
- rx: int reference, reference to x
- p2: int pointer, dynamically allocated memory with value 1024
- p3: int pointer, dynamically allocated array of size 4 with values {1, 2, 3, 4}
- p4: int pointer, value of p3
- p5: int pointer, dynamically allocated memory with value 0
- p6: int pointer, value of p5

### Count:
There are 8 objects/variables.

### Operations:
- Default initialization (int x;)
- Address-of operator (int* px = &x;)
- Reference declaration (int& rx = x;)
- Value initialization (int* p2 = new int{1024};)
- List initialization of array (int* p3 = new int[4]{1, 2, 3, 4};)
- Copy initialization (int* p4 = p3;)
- Dynamic memory deallocation (delete p2; and delete[] p3;)
- Value initialization (int* p5 = new int{0};)
- Copy initialization (int* p6 = p5;)
- Dynamic memory deallocation (delete p5;)

### Errors:

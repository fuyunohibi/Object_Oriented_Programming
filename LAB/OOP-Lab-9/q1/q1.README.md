## 1.1) Understanding object lifetime in C++ 
<hr></hr>

### In C++, the lifetime of an object is the period during which the object exists in memory and is valid. The lifetime of an object depends on how it is created and managed. some common ways objects can be created, destroyed, copied, and moved in different contexts:

<hr></hr>

- Automatic storage duration: Objects with automatic storage duration are created when the program enters the block 
  in which they are declared and are destroyed when the block exits. This includes local variables, function parameters, and non-static class members 
  declared without the "static" keyword.

- Static storage duration: Objects with static storage duration are created before the program starts executing 
  and are destroyed when the program exits. This includes global variables and class members declared with the "static" keyword.

- Dynamic storage duration: Objects with dynamic storage duration are created using the "new" operator and are destroyed using the "delete" operator.
  The lifetime of such objects is managed manually by the programmer.

- Copying and moving: When an object is copied or moved, a new object is created with the same or similar state as the original object.
  The original object remains valid unless it is explicitly destroyed or its lifetime ends.

### Automatic storage duration:

```
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Constructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    {
        MyClass obj1; // Create object using automatic storage duration
    }
    // obj1 is destroyed when the block exits

    return 0;
}
```

### Static storage duration:

```
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Constructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
};

MyClass obj1; // Create object using static storage duration

int main() {
    // obj1 is created before main() starts and is destroyed when main() exits

    return 0;
}
```

### Dynamic storage duration:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Constructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    {
        std::unique_ptr<MyClass> obj1(new MyClass); // Create object using dynamic storage duration
    }
    // obj1 is destroyed when it goes out of scope or when the program exits

    return 0;
}
```


### Copying and moving:

```
#include <iostream>

class MyClass {
public:
    MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Constructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
    MyClass(const MyClass& other) {
        std::cout << "Copying MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass& other) {
        std::cout << "Assigning MyClass" << std::endl;
        return *this;
    }
    MyClass(MyClass&& other) {
        std::cout << "Moving MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
    MyClass& operator=(MyClass&& other) {
        std::cout << "Moving MyClass" << std::endl;
        return *this;
    }
    ~MyClass() {
        std::cout << "Destructing MyClass" << std::endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    MyClass obj1; // Create object using automatic storage duration

    MyClass obj2(obj1); // Copy object

    MyClass obj3(std::move(obj1)); // Move object

    obj2 = obj3; // Copy assignment

    obj2 = std::move(obj3); // Move assignment

    return 0;
}
```
